# Bodybuilding Training

A bodybuilding training regimen consists of not only having a spot-on diet, but also a good training regimen.
In order for muscles to get bigger, you have to pump blood into the muscles which is accomplished by a systematic combination of intensity, volume and frequency.
However, you can't expect to have an impressive chest if you're still benching 135lbs.

Let's discuss the three main factors:

##### Intensity

High intensity emphasizes on few sets with maximum effort. This means heavy weight training with sometimes up to failure on each set.
The goal for high intensity training is to push your body to a point where it signals itself to grow.
One bodybuilder who is popular for this is Dorian Yates who would often do warm up sets then perform 2 sets to failure.

##### Volume

Volume refers to the total amount of effort done.
For example, you squat 5 sets of 5 reps for 135lbs. That's a total of 3375lbs volume.
Whereas if you did 3 sets of 12 reps for 135lbs, that's 4860lbs in volume.

##### Frequency

Frequency means how often you do a certain exercise in a week. The more often you do a certain exercise, the more your body becomes accustomed to it.

Training Regimen
================

The most efficient way to reach your goal, in my experience, is to periodize your training. This means, you'll have different rep ranges and volume to make sure you're improving strength, power and size.

An example of a periodize training would be:

- Day 1 - Strength-based routine (high intensity)
- Day 2 - Hypertrophy-based routine (high volume)
- Day 3 - Power-based routine (explosive movements)
- Day 1 - Hypertrophy-based routine (high volume)

This way, you're letting your body recover and at the same time having constant progress per week. These are called personal records.

Personal records aren't just exclusive to 1 rep max but in all rep ranges including reps of 20.

Warm ups
========

The goals of warm-ups are basically three things:

1. Add blood flow to the joints.
2. Kickstart your nervous system.
3. Increase your body's overall temperature.

An example of this would be doing air squats before a barbell squat exercise.
This ensures that before adding any heavy load on the body, your joints, nervous system, and muscles are stimulated thus preventing injury.

Here are some basic examples:

1. Leg day - Air Squats and hamstring stretches.
2. Chest day - push ups or light dumbbell press. Go for 15-20 reps.
3. Back - pull ups or light lats pull down 15-20 reps.

##### Mobility exercises

Mobility exercises aim to increase flexibility on the muscles which in turn would allow overall joint health, and constant muscle growth.

Examples would be:

1. Foam Rolling
2. Lacrosse Ball
3. Band stretches

1. Lifting heavy
2. with Proper-from,
3. and with High Intensity.
